# **The Impact of Screen Time and Study Patterns on Stress Levels**

## **Project Overview**
In todays age digital devices are used for a variatey of purposes including entertainment and academic activities. However, screen time can also impact the effectiveness of studying as it imposes a huge distraction, and hence may lead to a rise in stress levels. My project aims to explore the link between screen time, studying habits and its effect on my stress levels.

## **Motivation**
Im doing this project in hopes of getting an insight and optimizing my digital habits in order to achieve better academic performance and to reduce my stress levels. Although digital devices give us access to knowledge and allow us to learn more efficiently and gain knoweledge in a bigger variatey of topics, it also imposes a huge distraction that hinders hugely our study habits. By understanding the impact of screen time on studying and stress, students can find better ways to manage their digital habits, stay more focused, and perform better academically.
