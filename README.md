**The Impact of Screen Time on Study Patterns**

### Project Overview
In today's digital age, devices are widely used for both academic and entertainment purposes. However, excessive screen time may impact study effectiveness by introducing distractions that reduce focus. This project explores the relationship between screen time and study habits, analyzing how digital device usage affects study duration and productivity using objective data.

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to better understand digital habits and optimize them for improved academic performance. While technology provides access to knowledge and enhances learning, it can also create distractions that disrupt study routines. By examining the effects of screen time on studying, students can develop strategies to manage their digital habits and improve focus based on measurable data.

### Research Questions
- How does screen time affect study duration and effectiveness?
- What is the relationship between screen usage and study habits?
- Does prolonged screen usage influence study efficiency?

### Data Collection
#### Tools Used
- Notion
- Google Sheets
- Screen Time

#### Screen Time Data
- Collected from built-in phone and laptop tracking tools (e.g., Digital Wellbeing, Screen Time, RescueTime).
- Categorized into different app types: study-related (e.g., educational apps, research tools), entertainment/social media (e.g., YouTube, Instagram), and communication apps (e.g., WhatsApp, email).

#### Study Patterns
- Logged using Notion or Google Sheets by tracking study sessions over a defined period (e.g., 2 weeks).
- Recorded data includes:
  - Session duration (in minutes).
  - Subject studied (e.g., Math, Science).
  - Study methods (e.g., reading, problem-solving, note-taking).
  - Number of interruptions (e.g., notifications, app switches, or breaks initiated by device usage).
  - Objective productivity metrics: number of tasks completed (e.g., pages read, problems solved, or sections reviewed) during each session.

- **Added Objective Metrics**:
  - **Number of Interruptions**: A quantifiable measure (e.g., counting notifications or app switches) replaces the subjective perception of focus.
  - **Objective Productivity Metrics**: Instead of self-rating, productivity is now measured by concrete outputs, such as the number of tasks completed (e.g., pages read, problems solved). This provides an objective way to assess study effectiveness.
